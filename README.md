## Introduction 🎯
Get ready for an electrifying experience as we revolutionize clinical studies with ChatGPT (powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model) and improve the overall experience for study participants. Our mission is to streamline Clinnova's study protocol and data protection notice using cutting-edge techniques like string embeddings, vector databases, and OpenAI API services. 🤖

## Getting Started 🚦

1. **Open the two Colab Notebooks**: Open the two Colab Notebooks [SemanticSearchUsingEmbeddingVectors](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Fuenfgeld/ChatGPTHackathon/blob/main/SemanticSearchUsingEmbeddingVectors.ipynb) and [TextEmbedding](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Fuenfgeld/ChatGPTHackathon/blob/main/TextEmbedding.ipynb). 💻

2. **Mount your google drive**: Add the shared folder containing required material to your google drive and mount the folder into the colab book. 📦

3. **Add your OpenAI API key**: Obtain your OpenAI API key from the shared folder`APIkey.py`. 🔑

## Project Structure 📁
- `TextEmbeddingExample.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook to get started with text embeddings using OpenAI API. 📚
- `SemanticSearchUsingEmbeddingVectors.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook to get started with semantic embedding vector search. 📚

## Contributing 🤝
Unleash your inner genius and join us in crafting the future of clinical studies. Everyone is invited! Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting a pull request or raising an issue on the GitHub repository. 💡

Don't miss out on this exciting event filled with mind-blowing tech, networking opportunities, delicious snacks, and a chance to be part of a groundbreaking project! 🥳
